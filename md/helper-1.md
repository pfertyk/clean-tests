```python
def _validate_tickets(self, is_normal_user=True):
    # login as self.user or self.admin if not is_normal_user
    # create 2 events (one past, one upcoming)
    # assert events creation was successful
    # prepare complicated test data for 6 tickets
    # call the API to create tickets (3 past, 3 upcoming)
    # assert tickets creation was successful
    # return created tickets as a list
```
